REACT CODING TEST - MARTIN FOAKES

Single page application created through React.js, showing a feed of the current
most popular artists and tracks from the HeartThisAt Api.

The app makes use of the Bootstrap library and the Axios HTTP client for the
browser and node.js.

All required dependencies (Webpack, Babel etc.) are listed in the package.json
file and can be installed via the command line through Node Package Manager(npm):

Install NPM (with Node.js) -

Using Homebrew:
```
  brew install node

```

Install dependencies and run:

```
  npm install

  npm start

```

NOTES ON APPLICATION:

There is one feature of this application that I wished to include but at this
time could not due to the time constraints of the task. An infinite scroll
feature using updating Lifecycle Methods to update artist results at the bottom
of the page.

As this app in it's state now was the product of c.4 hours work, the suggested
time limit for the task I felt to go further would not be an accurate
representation of the work done.
